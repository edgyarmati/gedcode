/**
 * SQLite write resilience for the persistence layer (Plan 019 WP-1).
 *
 * SQLite serializes writers: a second connection that cannot immediately take
 * the write lock fails with `SQLITE_BUSY` / `SQLITE_LOCKED`. `PRAGMA
 * busy_timeout` (set in `Layers/Sqlite.ts`) makes SQLite *block* for a bounded
 * window before surfacing that error; this module is the second line of
 * defense — a jittered, bounded retry around a write transaction for the
 * residual cases (busy_timeout exhausted, a WAL checkpoint race, or a
 * `SQLITE_LOCKED` shared-cache conflict).
 *
 * **Why only busy/locked.** Retrying any other failure is unsafe: a constraint
 * violation, syntax error, or logic error is not transient, and re-running a
 * partially-applied non-idempotent statement could corrupt state. The retry is
 * therefore gated *strictly* on `SQLITE_BUSY` (primary result code 5) and
 * `SQLITE_LOCKED` (6), and on nothing else. We deliberately do **not** trust the
 * broader `SqlError.isRetryable` getter (it is also `true` for
 * connection/deadlock/serialization/statement-timeout reasons that SQLite does
 * not raise here).
 *
 * **Why we can't gate on `LockTimeoutError` alone.** Effect's
 * `classifySqliteError` maps busy/locked to a {@link LockTimeoutError} reason
 * only when it can read the primary result code from `cause.code` (string
 * `"SQLITE_BUSY"`) or `cause.errno`/`cause.code` (numeric). The Node `node:sqlite`
 * driver this server ships on reports the primary code on **`cause.errcode`**
 * instead (e.g. `{ code: "ERR_SQLITE_ERROR", errcode: 5, errstr: "database is
 * locked" }`), which the classifier never inspects — so a *real* busy/locked
 * surfaces as an `UnknownError`, not a `LockTimeoutError`. Gating on the reason
 * tag alone would therefore make the entire retry silently dead in production
 * while every synthetic test (which hand-builds a `LockTimeoutError`) stayed
 * green. {@link isRetryableSqlError} closes that gap by also narrowing the raw
 * `errcode` off the reason's `cause` — see {@link isNodeSqliteBusyOrLocked}.
 *
 * **Why retrying a transaction is safe.** `sql.withTransaction` rolls the whole
 * transaction back on failure, so a retry re-runs the body against the
 * pre-transaction state — the unit of work stays atomic and idempotent. Always
 * wrap the *entire* `sql.withTransaction(...)` effect (before the error is
 * mapped to a {@link PersistenceSqlError}, so the raw `SqlError.reason` is still
 * inspectable), never a fragment of it.
