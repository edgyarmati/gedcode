## Ged workflow role configuration parity

- Date: 2026-05-27
- Decision: Gedcode should present Ged workflow orchestration configuration as first-class UI, matching GedPi concepts: subagents enabled, intercom bridge, critique mode, and per-role provider/model/thinking settings.
- Scope note: Runtime invocation is currently implemented for `ged-explorer`; the configuration model should be extensible to planner, plan-reviewer, verifier, and worker without forcing all role runtimes to be implemented in one slice.
