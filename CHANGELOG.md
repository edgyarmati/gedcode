# Changelog

Release notes are grouped by released version. Add a `## X.Y.Z` section before running
`./release.sh stable ...` or `./release.sh nightly ...`.

## Unreleased

- Docs: Add upstream decision tracking for pending upstream-only work and record the initial implementation categories.

## 0.1.2

- Pin the desktop release builder to the ad-hoc-signing-compatible version and verify macOS artifacts before upload so unsigned builds can still be manually opened without Gatekeeper reporting them as damaged.

## 0.1.1

- Desktop
  - Fix in-app desktop update installation by preserving the updater-owned quit flow and using silent installs only on Windows.

- Release and packaging
  - Add release wrapper scripts and packaged-dev desktop identity metadata.
  - Keep packaged dev out of live mode and allow nightly releases after a stable release.

  - Ignore `docs/research` in format/lint checks and allow hosted web pairing deployments to use fork-owned router and channel domains.
- Ged workflow
  - Scope runtime checkpoints to each thread and guard checkpoint ownership.
  - Enforce auto-escalation and surface more accurate workflow status phases.
  - Clarify runtime escalation, Codex Ged subagent presets, and sequential role gates with main-thread fallback.
  - Show the workflow badge only while the latest turn is running and hide it while chat is idle.
- Provider support
  - Expose the Claude Fable model.
- UI
  - Fix light-mode contrast for destructive outline buttons such as connectivity Revoke actions.
